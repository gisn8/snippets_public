SCRIPT GOALS
To download the most recent specified OGRIP LBRS data for available Ohio counties for use within a geopackage database
and/or shapefiles reprojected into a common projection.
A windowed interface is not provided with the intent this is to be run in the background on a schedule.

OVERVIEW
First checks if projection files or original raw files only are requested. If so, only downloads those with no further
action taken.
Checks for existing local geopackage(gpkg) database where this data is stored. If one does not exist, creates a new
one.
If needed, downloads and reprojects a county boundaries layer into the gpkg from ODOT and creates a table listing all 
counties and the archive date of the downloaded LBRS data. 
Downloads a list of layer types from a list of counties from available OGRIP LBRS layers, reprojects to a common
projection, and puts them in a statewide geopackage with the option to also have a subset of reprojected shapefiles.

PREREQUISITES
- GDAL
- Python 3.6+
Windows users: It is recommended to download OSGeo4W network installer from https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/.
Using the installer, you can get GDAL which also comes with Python 3.
The Windows_py3_env_and_launch.bat needs to be in the same folder with Download_OGRIP_LBRS_Layers.py. 
Windows_py3_env_and_launch.bat
sets the environment settings for Python3 and runs the Download_OGRIP_LBRS_Layers.py; trying to run the Python script
on its own with the proper system settings and prerequisites will result in failure.

Please read the comments within each script file for more information and to set the variables as you need them.
