OVERVIEW
First checks if projection files or original raw files only are requested. If so, only downloads those with no further
action taken.
Checks for existing local geopackage(gpkg) database where this data is stored. If one does not exist, creates a new
one.
If needed, download and reproject a county boundaries layer into the gpkg from ODOT and create a table listing all 
counties and the archive date of the downloaded LBRS data. 
Download a list of layer types from a list of counties from available OGRIP LBRS layers, reproject to a common
projection, and put them in a statewide geopackage with the option to also have a subset of reprojected shapefiles.

PREREQUISITES
- GDAL
- Python 3.6+
Windows users: It is recommended to download OSGeo4W network installer from https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/.
Using the installer, you can get GDAL which also comes with Python 3.
You will then need to launch the python script using a python environment setting script. A py3_env.bat script should have been available
along with this file.
